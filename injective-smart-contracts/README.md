# Smart Contracts for the Injective Network

This repository has the sole purpose of learning how to use the Rust programming language in Injective smart contracts while coding along with the [Injective Documentation](https://docs.injective.network/). It is a personal documentation of moving forward in my learning journey.

## Exploring CosmWasm smart contracts

Code examples and most of the explanations I've added as comments are borrowed from [Injective Documentation](https://docs.injective.network/), getting started with `[your first Injective smart contract](https://docs.injective.network/develop/guides/injective-101/your-first-contract)`.
