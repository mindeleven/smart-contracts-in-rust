# Code Along with the CosmWasm book

This repository has the sole purpose of learning how to use the Rust programming language in CosmWasm smart contracts while coding along with the [CosmWasm book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/index.html). It is a personal documentation of moving forward in my learning journey.

## Exploring CosmWasm smart contracts

Code examples and most of the explanations I've added as comments are borrowed from [CosmWasm book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/index.html).
